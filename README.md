# Discord-Levels
A simple on_message() (and a command) code that allows you to create a levelling system for your python bot!

Once you download the folder, change the 'your_token_here' to your Bot Token, after that you will need levels.txt and message_count.txt to be in the same machine as the one your bot is running in. (E.g. if you are using PebbleHost, make sure to upload the files there for the code to work.)
